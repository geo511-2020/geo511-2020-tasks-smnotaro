After making the script for week 4's case study, I found arrange() to be particulary useful. It's a handy function to quickly arrange data in ascending or descending order. 
Another useful funciton is labs() to add things such as a title, subtitle, and x or y axes to a plot. I also like to use xlab() and ylab() sometimes to make it easier on my eyes to know what axis I'm labeling.

Lastly, element_blank() is also helpful to easily remove plot elements. For example, if grid lines are making it difficult to read a plot, element_blank() is great to take care of that setback.
